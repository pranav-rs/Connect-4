# Connect-4
Recreating the Connect 4 game using C++

Hey there! I'm starting the process of gradually uploading my old projects to Github(primarily because I am going to apply for the Software Developer role at Zoho,and one of my instructors recommended porting my projects). I would also(hopefully) start working on new projects soon.

Anyway,in this repository,I would be working on recreating the Connect 4 game(I've also heard it be called Four in a Row).
Although I do have my old project code with me,I thought it would be better if I do it over and perhaps,get a better approach.

Here's a link to the game! https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html


Changes before re-uploading:

Change 1:Adding a link to a site where you can view the rules of the game and also,play against AI. I'm also learning to use Github through this.

Changes after re-uploading:

ETA 1: I had originally uploaded this repository around the same time as 2048(24th June,2020). However, a friend of mine was not able to view it for some reason, and suggested uploading the files again. I have not made any changes to the code while re-uploading.
