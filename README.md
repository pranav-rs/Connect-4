# Connect-4
Recreating the Connect 4 game using C++

Hey there! I'm starting the process of gradually uploading my old projects to Github(primarily because I am going to apply for the Software Developer role at Zoho,and one of my instructors recommended porting my projects). I would also(hopefully) start working on new projects soon.

Anyway,in this repository,I would be working on recreating the Connect 4 game(I've also heard it be called Four in a Row).
Although I do have my old project code with me,I thought it would be better if I do it over and perhaps,get a better approach.

Here's a link to the game! https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html

Change 1:Adding a link to a site where you can view the rules of the game and also,play against AI. I'm also learning to use Github through this.
